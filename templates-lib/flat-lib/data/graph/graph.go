package graph

// Graph represents what an gsl graph should look like.
// It is not intended to be used by production code, but more like an internal building block for gsl graphs.
// It's not minimal, and was designed around flexibility and coverage.
// This interface can be used for both unweighted and weighted graph (see wgraph package).
type Graph[
	N any, // Type for graph node
	E any, // Type for graph edge
	W any, // Type for graph edge weight or node values
] interface {
	// SetDirection sets the directionality of the graph.

	// AddEdgeWeightOrDistance adds default weighted edge to the graph. If the graph is directional, then AddEdgeWeightOrDistance will only adds edge from n1 to n2. If the graph is undirectional, then both connections (n1 -> n2 and n2 -> n1) should be added.
